# Cplusplus-Program.

-Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project I was tasked with develop an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time. This project was required to retrieve user input for the initial investment amount, the monthly deposit, annual interest, and the number of years for investing. The program then needed to display a report that describes the year end balance and the total interest earned. Finally, it also needed to allow for the user to test different inputs.

-What did you do particularly well?
  I think what I did particularly well was keeping the program well formatted and organized, which allows it to be easily read and understood by others.

-Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could have improved my code by being a little more efficient. There were a few places where I used duplicate code, and there were ways I could have created more functions to help minimize this.

-Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I struggled the most with the for loop that caluclated the iterest accuratly. I think the hardest part of it might have been getting the nestled for loop to properly calculate the compound interest, and it also took me a while to realize that I even needed to add a nested for loop.

-What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I think that I learned a lot more about how to implement driver/header files and using a file to hold all the different functions for them. Though there were plenty of areas that could have used improvement, I really learn how writing code this way can keep everything well organized and easier to write.

-How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made this program maintainable by using clear naming conventions, detailed comments, and consistent formatting. I think that by doing so it not only makes the program easier to understand, but also easy to keep track of whats happening during the initial writing.
